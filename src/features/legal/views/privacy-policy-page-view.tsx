					<h2 className="font-medium text-2xl text-primary">Data we collect</h2>
					<p>
						Depending on your interaction with us, we may collect: contact data
						(such as name, email, phone, and company name), project data
						(requirements, feedback, and files you provide), billing data
						(invoicing and payment-related details), and technical usage data
						(such as IP address, browser/device information, and on-site
						behavior analytics).

					<h2 className="font-medium text-2xl text-primary">
						How we collect data
					</h2>
					<p>
						We collect information directly from you when you submit forms,
						request a proposal, communicate with our team, or share project
						content. We also collect limited technical information through
						cookies, similar storage, and the analytics and tag tools described
						under “Website technologies and third-party services” below.

						Website technologies and third-party services
					</h2>
					<p>
						The list below reflects tools wired into this website today. Public
						identifiers and script hosts are defined in our codebase alongside
						the implementation so they stay aligned with this page; when we
						change containers, hosts, or materially add tracking, we update this
						policy and the last updated date above.

							(container ID{" "}
							<span className="font-mono text-foreground">
								{GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_CONTAINER_ID}
							</span>
							): used to load and manage measurement and marketing tags. Tags
							inside the container can change over time without a code deploy.
							GTM and any third-party tags it fires may use cookies or similar
							technologies and are subject to their providers’ policies. We also
							send selected on-site events to the data layer (for example
							tracked interactions, contact funnel events, and high-level AI
							chat activity) according to configuration in the container.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-medium text-foreground">OpenPanel</span>:
							when the deployment is configured with OpenPanel, the browser
							loads analytics from{" "}
							<span className="font-mono text-foreground">
								{OPENPANEL_SCRIPT_ORIGIN}
							</span>{" "}
							and sends data to the API endpoint set for that environment.
							Depending on configuration, this can include page and screen
							views, outbound link clicks, element attributes, and session
							replay; replay is set up to mask form inputs. Some server-side
							events (such as contact form outcomes or AI chat request success
							and failure) may be recorded in OpenPanel without storing your
							full chat transcript as analytics metadata.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span className="font-medium text-foreground">WhatsApp</span>: the

							models to generate replies. Do not submit highly sensitive
							personal data, financial details, passwords, or confidential
							business secrets in the chat. If you choose to share contact
							details for follow-up, we use them to respond to your request in
							line with this policy. We may record operational or aggregated
							telemetry about the feature (such as whether a request succeeded)
							in our analytics tools.
